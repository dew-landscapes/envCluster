Title: Create Clusters From Records of Taxa
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Nigel",
           family = "Willoughby",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "nigel.willoughby@sa.gov.au")
Description: Records of taxa are turned into wide (taxa by site) data before a 
    range of potential clusterings are made. From these clusterings
    prefered clustering(s) can be selected using any combination of overall
    silhouette width, overall within group sum-of-squares, presence of an
    indicator taxa and/or presence of a single taxa at more than a threshold
    proportion of sites in a cluster.
